TouchPad Camera Tester

----------------

This is very simple application I made to be able to run particular functions
from the libcamera.so library. 

Instructions

1. You need to have the CM9 sources patched with several patches from
   gerrit. Use the following script to patch the sources:
   http://pastebin.com/8igJK9WF

2. Download the camtest sources to the ~/android/system/device/hp/tenderloin
   directory.  

3. Patch the BoardConfig.mk and device_tenderloin.mk and add camtest to
   PRODUCT_PACKAGES

4. Obtain the libcamera.so and liboemcamera.so from CM7a2.1 build and replace
   the ones from CM9 in: ~/android/system/vendor/hp/tenderloin/proprietary/lib
   The libraries used in CM9 are incorrect and won't load thus there's need to
   use the proper ones from CM7.

5. Run "make clean" before running the first build.

6. Run "brunch tenderloin" to make a build.

7. To run the camtest app on the device log into it using "adb shell" and
   execute camtest.
